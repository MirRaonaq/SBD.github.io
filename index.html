              <p>In this project, we will be focusing on sentence boundary detection (SBD) without punctuation marks. Researching current solutions from <a href="http://gmb.let.rug.nl/elephant/about.php" target="_blank">elephant</a> will provide us with their results. With the information gathered from the current data, I will be creating my own approach of SBD for the English and Arabic languages. </p>

                <p>A portion of Googles current success can be in large part to NLP. Google Now uses NLP for syntax, part of speech tagging and parsing in 60+ languages. Semantics for Google Search recognizes entities in text to figure out the best search results for the user. Knowledge extraction to learn relations between entities, recognize events, match entities between queries and documents. All of this cannot be done in a couple of years. To build a company like Google with the software and technology that have developed takes thousands of workers with more than 5 years of craft.

                <p>After completing half of my project on sbd without punctuation. I have come to the realization that it will not be possible to have one system that works for every language. No matter how advanced AI develops, there is no possible way to detect sentence segmentation error free. This is in large part to humans not perfecting punctuation in languages. Although, it might be easy for a human to read and decide where a sentence ends and begins. It’s not for a NLP because of the multitude of exceptions and non-exceptions.

                <p>Nearly 500 million people worldwide speak Arabic. The language of Arabic holds deep cultural, religious, and political significance. It is the fifth most spoken language in the world, the official language in 22 countries and is one of the six official United Nation languages. However, Arabic has received comparatively little attention in modern computational linguistics. It can be due to a number of reasons such as its complex tokenization. I believe once machine translation progresses, Semitic languages like Arabic will get more attention.

                <p>NLP is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It’s ability of a computer program to understand the human spoken language. Humans speak about 2,000 languages, each language also having their own set of rules. </p>
                <p><strong>Why is NLP Important? </p>
                  <p>In short, NLP helps with speech or text analytics. Some examples are text mining, machine translation, and automated question answering. It open doors to new possibilities of AI development, which can lead to efficient programs. </p>
                  <p><strong>Some NLP Tools:</p>
                    <p>These programs include various languages</p>

                    <p>Sbd for Arabic uses the following set of general rules:</p>
                    <p>• A period ending a sentence</p>
                    <p>• Based on the last word of the current sentence and the first word of the next sentence</p>
                    <p> There is no natural processing language tool for Arabic that can give us data for the error rates. I assume the error rate is higher than English because of the usage of punctuation in Arabic is peculiar. Also more research has been done for the English language.</p>

                    <p>Sbd for English uses the following set of general rules:</p>
                    <p>• A period ending a sentence</p>
                    <p>• The following token after a period is capitalized</p>
                    <p>• Multiple abbreviations not ending a sentence</p>
                    <p>These three strategies work 95% of the time. After including more rules like elephant does, sbd works 99.73%. That is very close to perfect, but not quite there yet. How can we make the error rate 0? Well the problem comes from ambiguous periods that stem from abbreviations, ellipses, and decimal points. There has been rules to combat this but never perfect.

                    <p>1. One major flaw is detecting the end of a sentence without punctuation, which is what my project research is about.
                    </p>
                    <p> 2. Due to low error rates, sbd is a problem some consider to be solved. However, these small errors still lead to misguided data and analytics.
                    </p>
                    <p> 3. Most tokenizers are rule-based on each specific language. Such as English has its own set of rules that cannot be used for Italian. This makes it difficult to adapt to new languages. I believe if natural language processing tools continue with rules based segmentation then it will always be hard to adapt to new languages.
